## 📝 Description

This project serves as the capstone evaluation for the **Computer Graphics** course. The challenge was to move beyond simple geometric shapes and model a complex, realistic **Programmer's Setup** using **Blender**, and then bring it to life on the web using **HTML5** and **Three.js**.

The result is a responsive portfolio where users can explore the workspace, interact with objects (like the monitor and TV), and learn about the creator through a seamless 3D interface.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🎨 3D Modeling (Blender)
* **Custom Assets:** All objects (desk, peripherals, environment) were modeled from scratch.
* **Optimization:** Models were optimized and exported in **.GLB** format for web performance.
* **UV Mapping:** Textures applied correctly for realistic screen displays.

### 💻 Web Integration (Three.js)
* **Interactive Scene:** Users can **Rotate**, **Pan**, and **Zoom** to explore the setup.
* **Raycasting:** Clickable objects! Clicking the **TV** opens a hidden modal window.
* **Dynamic Textures:** The computer monitor features animated text rendered in real-time using HTML Canvas.
* **Split Layout:** A modern UI design combining a scrollable HTML info section with a fixed 3D background.
